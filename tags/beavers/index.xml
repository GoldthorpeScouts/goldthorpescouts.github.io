      <description>&amp;lsquo;The best thing we did was swim in the rain. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure we were allowed to, but it was brilliant! I mean we were wet anyway, so I guess it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much about the weather.&amp;rsquo;
 Activities Beavers are our youngest members, and generally meet for an hour per week. They enjoy all that scouting has to offer; being introduced to outdoor activities, having the opportunity to be creative, explore their local community and experience the excitment of a Beaver Scout Sleepover with their friends.</description>
