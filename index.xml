      <description>&amp;lsquo;The best thing we did was swim in the rain. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure we were allowed to, but it was brilliant! I mean we were wet anyway, so I guess it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much about the weather.&amp;rsquo;
 Activities Beavers are our youngest members, and generally meet for an hour per week. They enjoy all that scouting has to offer; being introduced to outdoor activities, having the opportunity to be creative, explore their local community and experience the excitment of a Beaver Scout Sleepover with their friends.</description>

      <description>The best part of Scouting is definitely the camps. I love every activity we do apart from swimming. They told us the pool was 24 degrees centigrade. Minus 24 more like!’
 Activities For Cubs, excitement and adventure are key. Their programme offers a huge variety of activities surrounding areas of fitness, global and beliefs; whilst allowing them to be creative and get involved in their local communities. Cubs are introduced to exciting outdoor skills and take part in adventurous activities, as well as camps and residential experiences.</description>

      <description>Scouting has given me a fantastic opportunity to do lots of activities and things that people who are not in Scouts don’t get to do. It’s about having fun with good friends.
 Scouts aims to build and develop young people’s confidence, sense of adventure and outdoor skills, as well as encouraging them to explore their beliefs and attitudes and be creative. It offers them the independence to put these skills into practice at camps and even on international trips.</description>

      <description>All the Groups leaders are volunteers. They give their time for free. But they are trained volunteers - the Scout Association has a thorough training programme that all Leaders have to undertake.
All leaders have to undergo a full Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check, supply personal references and be approved by an Adult Appointments Committee before their first appointment. Appointments are also subject to regular review and renewal.</description>

      <description>Subs Subs are the lifeblood of our scouting programme and they enable us to deliver a fun and diverse programme. There are a lot of costs involved in running a Scout troop from insurance to our membership of the Scout movement.
Subs is a yearly cost of £144 that is split into 12 monthly payments. This means that subs are paid throughout the year and not just at each meeting.</description>

      <description>Goldthorpe Scout Group was one of the first 100 groups in the world to be established in 1908, originally as the 1st Don &amp;amp; Dearne (Goldthorpe), according to a Scout Association fact sheet, which you can access here: http://scouts.org.uk/f103775
In the 1970’s the council boundaries changed so that Goldthorpe came under Barnsley rather than Doncaster, and the Scout group became known as the 6th Barnsley (Goldthorpe) Scout Group and ran successfully until around the start of the new millennium.</description>
