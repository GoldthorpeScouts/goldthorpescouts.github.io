      <description>Welcome to our new look website
We have spent some time creating a new site with a much better layout and lots of much better content to help you find out about us.
We hope you like it.
The entire site has been created using free and open source software. The source code for the site is hosted here https://github.com/GoldthorpeScouts/goldthorpescouts
You can see all of our content and you could even contribute a new blog post.</description>
