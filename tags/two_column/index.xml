 Activities Beavers are our youngest members, and generally meet for an hour per week. They enjoy all that scouting has to offer; being introduced to outdoor activities, having the opportunity to be creative, explore their local community and experience the excitment of a Beaver Scout Sleepover with their friends.</description>
