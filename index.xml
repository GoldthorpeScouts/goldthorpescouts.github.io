      <description>&amp;lsquo;The best thing we did was swim in the rain. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure we were allowed to, but it was brilliant! I mean we were wet anyway, so I guess it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much about the weather.&amp;rsquo;
 Activities Beavers are our youngest members, and generally meet for an hour per week. They enjoy all that scouting has to offer; being introduced to outdoor activities, having the opportunity to be creative, explore their local community and experience the excitment of a Beaver Scout Sleepover with their friends.</description>

      <description>The best part of Scouting is definitely the camps. I love every activity we do apart from swimming. They told us the pool was 24 degrees centigrade. Minus 24 more like!’
 Activities For Cubs, excitement and adventure are key. Their programme offers a huge variety of activities surrounding areas of fitness, global and beliefs; whilst allowing them to be creative and get involved in their local communities. Cubs are introduced to exciting outdoor skills and take part in adventurous activities, as well as camps and residential experiences.</description>

      <description>This is an example of multiple columns.
Unfortunately it needs the author to write html to work (though I could put everything in the front matter!) Left Column You can fill this in with html or markdown  And another subheading Adipiscing faucibus nunc placerat. Tempus adipiscing turpis non blandit accumsan eget lacinia nunc integer interdum amet aliquam ut orci non col ut ut praesent. Semper amet interdum mi.

      <description>Scouting has given me a fantastic opportunity to do lots of activities and things that people who are not in Scouts don’t get to do. It’s about having fun with good friends.
 Scouts aims to build and develop young people’s confidence, sense of adventure and outdoor skills, as well as encouraging them to explore their beliefs and attitudes and be creative. It offers them the independence to put these skills into practice at camps and even on international trips.</description>

      <description>All the Groups leaders are volunteers. They give their time for free. But they are trained volunteers - the Scout Association has a thorough training programme that all Leaders have to undertake.
All leaders have to undergo a full Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) criminal records check, supply personal references and be approved by an Adult Appointments Committee before their first appointment. Appointments are also subject to regular review and renewal.</description>

      <description>Goldthorpe Scout Group was one of the first 100 groups in the world to be established in 1908, originally as the 1st Don &amp;amp; Dearne (Goldthorpe), according to a Scout Association fact sheet, which you can access here: http://scouts.org.uk/f103775
In the 1970’s the council boundaries changed so that Goldthorpe came under Barnsley rather than Doncaster, and the Scout group became known as the 6th Barnsley (Goldthorpe) Scout Group and ran successfully until around the start of the new millennium.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://scouts.scottguymer.co.uk/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</link>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
